This doc walks you through the principles Windsurf expects when building web apps. Itâ€™s equal parts style guide, safety rail, and secret decoder ring.

## 1. Start with the User

- Map user flows before writing code.
- Validate UI via wireframes or mockups.
- Document each feature's purpose and expected outcomes.

## 2. Structure Your Project

your-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ cypress/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ support/
â””â”€â”€ public/


## 3. CSS and Styling
Use SCSS with BEM structure.

Limit nesting, extract mixins and variables.

Normalize styles globally (normalize.css or CSS reset).

## 4. Build with Components
Use atomic design: Button â†’ Form â†’ Page.

Reuse and document each component.

Wrap accessibility into each component by default.

## 5. Test Everything
Write Cypress tests using [data-cy=...] attributes.

Abstract flows with custom commands and fixtures.

Run tests on each pull request and nightly.

## 6. Lock Down Security
Sanitize DOM input (XSS) and validate forms.

Enforce HTTPS, CSP, and secure headers.

Use session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict.

## 7. Performance & Accessibility
Optimize assets.

Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA, keyboard, labels).

Lighthouse audits should score 90+ in A11y & Performance.

## 8. Deploy Safely
CI runs tests, audits, and lints.

Use versioning and changelogs.

Set up alerting for downtime or slow responses.

## 9. ðŸš€ Pro Tips
Prefer readability over cleverness.

If youâ€™re re-writing the same snippet in 3+ tests or files, extract it.

If you need !important, question the universe.
