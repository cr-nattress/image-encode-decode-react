# Image Encode Decode React with shadcn/ui

A React application for encoding and decoding images, enhanced with shadcn/ui components. This project demonstrates how to integrate shadcn/ui with Create React App using CRACO.

## Features

- Image encoding and decoding functionality
- Modern UI with shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS integration
- CRACO configuration for CRA customization

## shadcn/ui Integration

This project showcases the integration of shadcn/ui components in a Create React App project. The integration was done manually since shadcn/ui's CLI tools are primarily designed for Next.js and Vite.

Key integration points:
- CRACO for PostCSS configuration
- Tailwind CSS setup
- Manual component implementation
- Coexistence with SCSS styling system

For detailed implementation steps, see the [shadcn-implementation-guide.md](./research/shadcn-implementation-guide.md) in the research folder.
